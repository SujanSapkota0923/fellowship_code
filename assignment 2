-   **Create a new user**:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER fellowship WITH PASSWORD 'hello123';
    ```

-   **Create a new database**:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE fellowship;
    ```

-   **Grant full access on the database to the user**:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE fellowship TO fellowship;

To resolve permission problems, grant the necessary privileges and change the schema owner:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO fellowship;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO fellowship;
```
